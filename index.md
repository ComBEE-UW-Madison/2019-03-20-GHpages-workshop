As an academic researcher at any level (technician, facillitator, graduate student, postdoc, professor, etc.), you want to have an accessible platform for showcasing your work and contact information. There are many outlets through which to create a professional website, such as WIX, GoogleSites, Wordpress, Squarespace and others. However, some of these providers may not be free, require some knowledge of HTML/CSS, or are cumbersome to maintain. Github Pages powered by Jekyll are free, reproducible, and open-source ways to hosting a professional, organization, or project website. Templates can be modified using local `git` or directly through Github like any other files hosted on Github. 


This Github Pages lesson was created by modifying the git-novice lessons [found here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) in order to teach how to customize a template gh-pages / jekyll
repository to make a personal webpage. 


> ## Prerequisites

> Some previous experience with the shell is expected,
> *but isn't mandatory*.

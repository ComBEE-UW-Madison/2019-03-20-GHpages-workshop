## Prior to the workshop

Please see [this section of the workshop template][workshop-setup]
for instructions on installing Git.  Windows users should also 
follow the instructions for installing the text editor as well.

Once the above is completed users also need to install ruby and bundler.
You can do so by following the directions in [the Requirements
section of this webpage][ruby-jekyll-setup].

## During the workshop:

We'll do our work in the `Desktop` folder so make sure you
change your working directory to it with:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop
~~~
{: .bash}
